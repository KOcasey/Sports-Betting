From 5d ago 06.00 EST Russia suffers highest casualties since first week of invasion – UK intelligence The latest defence intelligence update from the UK Ministry of Defence says that over the past two weeks, Russia has likely suffered its highest rate of casualties since the first week of the invasion of Ukraine. The update, posted to Twitter, continues: The Ukrainian General Staff release daily statistics on Russian casualties. Although Defence Intelligence cannot verify Ukraine’s methodology, the trends the data illustrate are likely accurate. The mean average for the last seven days was 824 casualties per day, over four times the rate reported over June-July 2022. Ukraine also continues to suffer a high attrition rate. The uptick in Russian casualties is likely due to a range of factors including lack of trained personnel, coordination, and resources across the front – this is exemplified in Vuhledar and Bakhmut. Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 12 February 2023

4d ago 13.04 EST That’s it from me, Charlie Moloney, and the Guardian’s live coverage of the Ukraine war for now. Before I go, here’s a roundup of today’s developments: The latest defence intelligence update from the UK Ministry of Defence says that over the past two weeks, Russian forces are likely to have had their highest rate of casualties since the first week of the invasion of Ukraine.

Appearing on the BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda , cast doubt on whether Poland will be able to supply Ukraine with fighters jets. Duda said sending F-16 aircraft would be a “very serious decision” that was “not easy to take”.

Yevgeny Prigozhin, the founder of Russia’s Wagner group, said the mercenary force had taken the village of Krasna Hora , on the northern edge of the embattled city of Bakhmut in Ukraine’s Donetsk region, Reuters reported. In an audio message published by his press service on the messaging app Telegram, Prigozhin said: “Today the settlement of Krasna Hora was taken by the assault troops of the Wagner private military company.”

Ukraine’s defences are holding along the frontline in Donetsk, with the fiercest battles raging for the cities of Vuhledar and Maryinka, Kyiv’s top military commander said on Saturday, Reuters reports. Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, commander-in-chief of Ukraine’s armed forces, said Russia was carrying out 50 attacks a day in Donetsk, a region in Ukraine’s south-east that Moscow has been trying to occupy fully.

4d ago 11.11 EST Austria has come under heavy criticism for granting visas that will allow sanctions-hit Russian lawmakers to attend a Vienna meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the Associated Press reports. The issue highlights the delicate balancing act the European country has engaged in while trying to maintain its longstanding position of military neutrality during the war in Ukraine. The Austrian government has condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine almost a year ago but also stressed the need to maintain diplomatic relations with Moscow. Moscow plans to send delegates to the 23-24 February meeting of the OSCE’s parliamentary assembly, including 15 Russian lawmakers who are under European Union sanctions. Among them are the deputy Duma chair Pyotr Tolstoy and his fellow parliament member Leonid Slutsky. In a letter to Austria’s chancellor, foreign minister and other officials, 81 OSCE delegates from 20 countries, including France, Canada, Britain, Poland and Ukraine, called upon the Austrian government to prohibit the participation of the sanctions-hit Russians. “It is important to remember that Russian parliamentarians are an integral part of the power system and complicit in the crimes Russia commits every day in Ukraine,” read the letter, which was seen by the Associated Press. “They have no place in an institution tasked with promoting sincere dialogue and opposition to the war.” The letter calling for the Austrian government to prohibit the participation of the sanctions-hit Russians was sent to the country’s chancellor, Karl Nehammer (pictured), by 81 OSCE delegates from 20 countries.

4d ago 10.57 EST Iran smuggled drones into Russia using boats and state airline, sources reveal Martin Chulov Our Middle East correspondent, Martin Chulov, has an exclusive report on the methods used by Iran to smuggle weaponry to Russia for use in its war on Ukraine. Iran has used boats and a state-owned airline to smuggle new types of advanced long-range armed drones to Russia for use in its war on Ukraine, sources inside the Middle Eastern country have revealed. At least 18 of the drones were delivered to Vladimir Putin’s navy after Russian officers and technicians made a special visit to Tehran in November, where they were shown a full range of Iran’s technologies. On that occasion, the 10-man Russian delegation selected six Mohajer-6 drones, which have a range of around 200km and carry two missiles under each wing, along with 12 Shahed 191 and 129 drones, which also have an air to ground strike capability. Unlike the better known Shahed 131 and 136 drones, which have been heavily used by Russia in kamikaze raids against Ukrainian targets, the higher flying drones are designed to deliver bombs and return to base intact.

4d ago 08.52 EST Tom Bryant Two captured former Wagner soldiers have described their experiences of fighting with the mercenary group in Ukraine. Speaking to CNN, the two fighters – who were both recruited in prison, fought in Ukraine and captured – described “first wave” attacks near the village of Bilohorivka that they likened to first world war advances. “There were 90 of us. Sixty died in that first assault, killed by mortar fire. A handful remained wounded,” said one. “If one group is unsuccessful, another is sent right away. If the second one is unsuccessful, they send another group.” He said there was little support for the injured or dying. “If you’re wounded, you roll away on your own at first, any way you can, somewhere neutral where there’s no fire, and if there’s no one around, you administer first aid to yourself,” he said. Should someone disobey orders for commanders, the consequences are lethal. “One man stayed at a position, he was really scared, it was his first assault,” said one of the former soldiers. “We received an order to run forward. But the man hid under a tree and refused. This was reported to the command and that was it. He was taken 50 metres away from the base. He was digging his own grave and then was shot.”

4d ago 07.04 EST Summary It is 2pm in Kyiv. Here are the latest developments in the war in Ukraine: Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, has cast doubt on whether it would be able to supply Ukraine with fighters jets . Duda said sending F-16 aircraft would be a “very serious decision” that was “not easy to take”.

The latest defence intelligence update from the UK Ministry of Defence says that over the past two weeks, Russia has likely suffered its highest rate of casualties since the first week of the invasion of Ukraine.

Russian forces over the weekend continued to shell Ukrainian cities amid a grinding push to seize more land in the east of the country. One person was killed and one more was wounded on Sunday morning by the shelling of Nikopol, a city in the southeastern Dnipropetrovsk region, Governor Serhii Lysak reported. The shelling damaged four residential buildings, a vocational school and a water treatment facility.

Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg will end his term as planned in October , a spokesperson for the alliance said, after a newspaper reported a further extension was in the works.

Yevgeny Prigozhin, the founder of Russia’s Wagner group , has said the mercenary force had taken the village of Krasna Hora, on the northern edge of the embattled city of Bakhmut in Ukraine’s Donetsk region,

Galina Danilchenko, the Russia-installed mayor of the Ukrainian city Melitopol in south-eastern Zaporizhzhia region, said on Saturday one civilian died in overnight shelling of Melitopol by Ukrainian forces . Two people were also injured, she wrote on the Telegram social media app.

First reports indicate that three Russian S-300 missiles hit the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv on Saturday night , regional governor Oleh Sinehubov wrote on the Telegram messaging app. “One infrastructure facility was damaged. Information about the victims and the scale of the destruction is being clarified,” he said.

Ukraine’s forces are holding defence along the frontline in Donetsk, including in the besieged town of Bakhmut , with the fiercest battles raging for the cities of Vuhledar and Maryinka, Kyiv’s top military commander said on Saturday. Valerii Zaluzhnyi did not specify where the gains were. He added that Ukrainian forices are trying to “stabilise” the frontline around Bakhmut, a city in the eastern Donbas region, which has become the focal point of Ukrainian resistance to Russia’s invasion and of Moscow’s drive to regain battlefield momentum.

Russia is ready for negotiations with Ukraine, but without preconditions, state media have reported the Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergey Vershinin, as saying. In an interview with state-run Zvezda television, Vershinin said it was not Ukraine, but the US and the EU that should make the decision on talks with Russia. Ukraine’s presidential adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, who headed the country’s negotiating team in the early phases of the conflict, said “talks are out of the question”.

Zemfira, one of Russia’s most popular singers, has been placed on a list of “foreign agents ” on grounds that she supported Ukraine and criticised Russia’s “special military operation” in that country, according to the Russian justice ministry. The ministry has added several other people to its “foreign agents” list, including opposition politician Dmitry Gudkov , political analyst Abbas Gallyamov, and activists Aleksandra Kazantseva and Tatyana Nazambaeva for “LGBT propaganda”.

Immigration authorities in Argentina are cracking down on Russian women who since the invasion of Ukraine have started travelling to Buenos Aires to give birth in order to gain Argentinian citizenship for their children. The director of Argentina’s immigration office, Florencia Carignano, said on Friday that a judicial investigation has been launched into what she described as a lucrative business that promises Argentinian passports for the Russian parents.
