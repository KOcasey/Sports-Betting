The Kansas City Chiefs have opened as betting favorites to win Super Bowl LVIII next season.

The reigning AFC champions are +550 (bet $100 to win $550) at DraftKings Sportsbook. The Buffalo Bills follow closely behind (+650), while the San Francisco 49ers (+700) and Philadelphia Eagles (+800) are the top two from the NFC.

Despite once again failing to advance past the NFC divisional round, the Dallas Cowboys are +1400 to lift the Lombardi Trophy, the sixth-best odds in the field.

The Houston Texans and Arizona Cardinals are considered the biggest long shots at +10000.

The moneylines are bound to move based on how the offseason unfolds.

The Texans and Cardinals are both still looking for a head coach, and the outlook for the latter could shift dramatically based on how Kyler Murray's recovery from a torn ACL progresses and who gets positioned as his backup.

The New York Jets (+2500) could leap ahead of the Cincinnati Bengals (+900) and Los Angeles Chargers (+2200) if they get Lamar Jackson or Aaron Rodgers as their starting quarterback.

Likewise, the Niners have plenty of questions at the quarterback position with Trey Lance and Brock Purdy both in the hunt for the starting job.

The Chiefs' position is unlikely to change, though.

The 2022 season was supposed to be a retooling year. The team traded Tyreek Hill to the Miami Dolphins and lost the secondary combo of Tyrann Mathieu and Charvarius Ward to free agency.

Kansas City wasn't going to fall off a cliff, but ceding AFC supremacy to the Bills or Bengals looked plausible. Instead, Patrick Mahomes guided his squad to a third Super Bowl appearance in four years.

Unless Mahomes plans on retiring, the Chiefs are bound to lead the Super Bowl discussion again in 2023.
