Draymond Green is no stranger to Washington, D.C., having now made two trips to the White House as a core member of four Warriors championships.

While fielding questions from reporters Tuesday from the nation's capital, Green pinpointed his ideal role if he ever made a career pivot into politics.

"President Draymond? I don’t know if anybody in this country wants me as president," Green said with a smile. "Secretary of defense, though? There we go."

Green's resume looks slightly different than current Secretary of Defense Lloyd James Austin III, but there's no denying he brings some spectacular defensive bonafides to the table. Green is a seven-time member of the NBA's All-Defensive team and the 2016-17 NBA Defensive Player of the Year.

Although Green won't be submitting his name on any presidential campaigns, he believes Steph Curry could be qualified.

“I thought Steph’s speech was incredible,” Green said. “I think Steph could one day run for president of the United States. What better person? He’s smart; he’s put together. He doesn’t really make mistakes. Why not?"

Green has played 11 seasons with Curry, but he's still learning from his teammate to this day.

"[Curry recently] said, ‘The one thing I always try to do is accept responsibility first and figure everything else out after that,' " Green said. "That was a great lesson for me as well."
