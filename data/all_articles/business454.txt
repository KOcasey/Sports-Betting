Managing your business's inventory can be expensive. Amazon FBA may be a lucrative alternative to sourcing, storing, and shipping your inventory, and Amazon only charges 10% to 15% off your margins. If you want to learn how to convert your business to an Amazon FBA or Shopify Dropshipping model, check out The 2023 Business Model and Strategies Bundle, featuring courses on Amazon FBA and Shopify.

Amazon FBA and Shopify Dropshipping are two options for accomplishing similar goals, and both could benefit your business by saving you money on inventory storage and order fulfillment.

Start with Amazon FBA: The 2023 Business Model & Strategies Course. This 2.5-hour course taught by drop shipper Paul Heidiri covers which items tend to be profitable on Amazon, how you can generate high-quality sales copy, where you might find suppliers, and more of the practicalities of running your business through Amazon.

If you want to expand your business opportunities, you could even try selling existing products on Amazon. Amazon Automation creates a partnership between you and Amazon's biggest companies, so you can sell their products using the dropship model while earning passive income.

Amazon isn't your only dropshipping option. Join six million other businesses in running your own Shopify store, and the A-Z Shopify Dropshipping course could teach you how to make it profitable. Study how you can buy physical products or license digital products for sale on your own online store. Amazon may get a lot of traffic, but you can study how to use Facebook Business Manager and Facebook ads to draw more visitors to your Shopify.
