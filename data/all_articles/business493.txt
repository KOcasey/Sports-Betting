From 2 Feb 2023 07.07 EST Bank: inflation likely to have peaked The Bank of England believes inflation has probably peaked, in the UK and other advanced economies too. In a summary of today’s decision, the Bank says: Global consumer price inflation remains high, although it is likely to have peaked across many advanced economies, including in the United Kingdom. Wholesale gas prices have fallen recently and global supply chain disruption appears to have eased amid a slowing in global demand. Many central banks have continued to tighten monetary policy, although market pricing indicates reductions in policy rates further ahead.



2 Feb 2023 11.39 EST FTSE 250 index soars on hopes interest rates near peak In the City, shares have ended the day higher as traders welcome signs that central banks may be slowing their interest rate increases. The UK’s blue-chip FTSE 100 index has closed 59 points higher, or +0.76%, at 7820 points – approaching January’s four-year highs. The smaller FTSE 250 index, which is more domestically-focused, surged by 3.6% to its highest level since last May. Cruise operator Carnival (+13.2%) and consumer publishing group Future (+13%) led the risers. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, explains: European markets have moved strongly higher after the Bank of England and European Central Bank both raised rates by 50bps which was in line with expectations, with the DAX moving to a new 11-month high, while the FTSE250 has outperformed the FTSE100. While the tone of both press conferences would appear to suggest that both central banks have further to go in raising rates, markets appear to be taking the view that we’re near a peak as far as rates are concerned, and even if they aren’t done yet, they are close, sending bond yields falling sharply across the board.



2 Feb 2023 11.18 EST What the Bank of England interest rate rise means for you Today’s interest rate rise is yet more bad news for the approximately 2.2 million people on a variable rate mortgage, who are also grappling with higher fuel and energy bills, my colleague Zoe Wood explains. Many now face paying hundreds of pounds extra a year. About half of those 2.2 million are either on a base rate tracker or discounted-rate deal. The other half are paying their lender’s standard variable rate (SVR). A tracker directly follows the base rate, so your payments will almost certainly soon reflect the full rise. On a tracker now at 4.5%, the interest rate would rise to 5%, adding £41 a month to a £150,000 repayment mortgage with 20 years remaining. The monthly payment on such a mortgage would rise from £949 to £990. Of course, for those with bigger mortgages, the numbers will be bigger. On a £500,000 mortgage the monthly payment will rise by £139 to £3,301. Those who must remortgage their home loans this year also face an increase in borrowing costs. Higher interest rates wil also affect those with credit cards and loans. Here’s the full story: What does the Bank of England interest rate rise mean for you? Read more



2 Feb 2023 11.18 EST Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey has told Bloomberg TV that the bank has a “long way to go” in its fight against inflation. He also (again) flagged the bank’s decision to drop the word “forcefully” from its forward guidance on rate hikes, saying: “We are going to react to the information and the evidence that we see. We haven’t pre-announced an intention.”



2 Feb 2023 11.05 EST Following today’s interest rate decision, Andrew Bailey has been interviewed by several news outlets including CNBC. He’s told them that he’s not saying the Bank is done raising interest rates, as the world is too uncertain. Bailey says: “I’m not saying ‘This is it, we’re done’, because the world is too uncertain in our case. “There is an encouraging downward path of inflation in our central projection. But there’s a big risk. We’ve got the biggest risk in our forecast on inflation on the upside that we’ve ever had. Tune into @cnbci at 4pm GMT for my interview with BOE Governor Andrew Bailey

2 Feb 2023 10.54 EST Kalyeena Makortoff The impending recession could leave borrowers struggling to repay their debts, the high street bank Santander UK warned today, as it put aside more cash to protect itself from potential defaults. The UK arm of the Spanish bank said on Thursday that while the outlook for the British economy remained uncertain, a recession in 2023 was likely. It said that despite government support for energy bills, rising prices would continue to eat away at disposable income, which “could impact lending repayments”. The warning was issued alongside the bank’s full-year results, which showed the lender put aside £321m in 2022 to cover potential defaults, compared with the £233m it released a year earlier as Covid restrictions began to lift. More here: UK borrowers may struggle to repay debt as economy worsens, says Santander Read more Santander also warned house prices are set to tumble back to 2021 levels, PA Media reports. The Spanish-owned group is pencilling in a 10% fall in house prices this year as interest rate hikes knock homebuyer demand and a 1.3% contraction in the wider UK economy over 2023.



2 Feb 2023 10.39 EST The pound has hit its lowest level against the US dollar since mid-January, as traders ponder whether the Bank of England has taken UK interest rates towards their peak today. Sterling dropped as low as $1.223, down from as high as $1.24 early this morning, before recovering a little to $1.229. Neil Mehta, BlueBay portfolio manager at RBC BlueBay Asset Management says the Bank is now at a ‘difficult juncture’, having raised base rate to 4%. While dropping language around forward guidance will allow flexibility at coming meetings, more than just caution is required before declaring victory. The improved growth and inflation seem premature - the full effect on higher mortgage payments and higher energy costs have yet to be fully digested by consumers, with real incomes set to deteriorate further. Ongoing strike action and a depleted labour pool will keep wage pressures high, with politicians having little manoeuvrability. Slumpflation is becoming entrenched and the balancing act between core inflation and growth will become harder to maintain over the coming months. Moreover, policy and political uncertainty is set to remain high, with lower GBP the release valve for market participants.



2 Feb 2023 10.22 EST Full story: Bank of England raises UK interest rates to 4% Phillip Inman The Bank of England has blamed the inflationary impact of higher than expected wage rises for an increase in interest rates from 3.5% to 4%, my colleague Phillip Inman writes. The move, announced at noon today, piles more pressure on mortgage payers and businesses struggling to pay off their loans, he points out. Amid calls from unions for higher wages to protect against the worst falls in living standards for 100 years, a majority of the Bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC) said the 0.5 percentage point rise was needed after a jump in private sector wages above the central bank’s previous forecasts. Marking its 10th consecutive rate increase, the Bank said the economy would enter a shorter and shallower recession than it predicted last year – with output falling by 1% from peak to trough compared with a 3% drop it said in November. Bank staff now expected GDP to have grown by 0.1% in the final quarter of 2022, stronger than predicted in November. That would mean the UK did not enter a technical recession in 2022, as previously thought after the economy shank by 0.3% in the third quarter. The UK economy is forecast to shrink in each quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024 before staging a modest recovery. The Bank said the hit to trade from Brexit was being felt sooner than previously expected. “The effects of Brexit on trade are now estimated to be emerging more quickly than previously assumed, and that lowers productivity somewhat.” More here: Bank of England raises UK interest rates to 4% Read more

2 Feb 2023 10.11 EST PA Media have a good take on the Bank of England’s warning today that the hit to the UK economy from Brexit is coming through faster than had previously been expected. Speaking at a press conference following the Bank’s latest interest rate hike, Ben Broadbent, the deputy governor for monetary policy, said they had not changed their overall assessment of the economic impact of Brexit (as covered here). He acknowledged, however, that they had not expected to see the effect on growth figures to come through quite so quickly. “Brexit … has been something that has pulled on our potential output in our country and that’s been our assessment for many years. “We’ve not changed our estimate of the long-running effects, but we’ve brought some of them forward and we think they’re probably coming in faster than we first expected.” He added: “Yes it (Brexit) is having some effect on growth, although ultimately no bigger effect than we assessed some years ago. “Based on the numbers for trade and some degree for the numbers on investment, we think these effects are coming through faster than initially envisaged.”



2 Feb 2023 09.54 EST Although the Bank has forecast a shallower recession than feared, its growth projections are still rather weak, as Sky’s Ed Conway shows here: This isn’t one of the main charts in the @bankofengland forecasts today but it might be one of the most important.

Come 2026 the UK economy will still be smaller than it was in 2019.

2 Feb 2023 09.44 EST Bank raises interest rates to 4%: the City reacts Reaction to the Bank of England’s decision has been flooding in. Here’s some of the best so far. Moody’s Analytics economist Thomas Sgouralis says today’s rate rise won’t be the last in this cycle. “The Bank of England has raised rates from 3.5% to a 14 year high of 4%, the tenth consecutive increase in the policy rate since December 2021, underscoring its fight against inflation in the UK, which is the highest among G7 economies. Despite inflation showing signs of moderation, and with an economy that is vulnerable, today’s meeting is unlikely to be the end of the tightening cycle. We expect the BoE to take the policy interest rate to 4.5% before it pauses, since inflation is expected to start declining significantly from the middle of the year forward as the energy costs and consumption ease.” A graph showing UK interest rates rising to 4% today Alexander Batten, fixed income portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investments predicts the Bank of England is close to ending its interest rate increases – perhaps after one more hike, to 4.25%, next month The Bank’s forward guidance has been watered down even further. Language around forceful hikes, i.e 50bp or higher, has been removed, and more tightening has been tied to evidence of more persistent inflationary pressures appearing. The Bank have indicated the data they are looking at for this point – wages, services inflation and inflation expectations. The soft data suggests a significant weakening of the labour market ahead but we suspect this may not come soon enough to prevent one final 25bp hike in March. Paul Dales, chief UK Economist at Capital Economics, doesn’t see the Bank cutting interest rates during 2023: While raising rates by 50 basis points (bps) today, from 3.50% to 4.00%, the Bank of England implied that rates are very close to their peak. We still think that rates may rise to 4.50%, but perhaps via two 25bps increases rather than one 50bps rise. Either way, we think that lingering domestic inflation pressures will force the Bank to keep interest rates at their peak for all of this year. ING’s Developed Markets Economist James Smith and Senior Rates Strategist Antoine Bouvet are sceptical that today’s rate hike will be the last. They say: “Below-target inflation forecasts, more muted language on future tightening, and a warning about the impact of past rate hikes, all signal that Bank Rate is close to peaking. We expect one further 25bp rate hike in March, though we think a rate cut is unlikely for at least a year. “For several months now, the Bank has been warning that it expects to continue hiking and that it could do so forcefully. The minutes of the last meeting confirmed that “forcefully” can be understood as meaning 50bp rate hike increments. So the fact that the Bank has dropped this reference suggests any future rate rises are likely to be smaller – and that’s further reinforced by an admission that the impact of past rate hikes is still largely to feed through to the economy. Martin Beck, chief economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, thinks the Bank is still too pessimistic about the economic outlook, despite predicting a shallower recession. The economy is still expected to shrink in 2024 on a calendar-year basis, despite pressure from high inflation fading. Households being expected to continue saving substantially more than pre-COVID-19 norms is one reason behind this. But this may be a questionable assumption given the significant savings accumulated by households during the pandemic and the likelihood that the mood-music around the economy will steadily improve, boosting consumers’ appetite to save less and spend more. Paul Diggle, deputy chief economist at abrdn, explains how the Bank of England has changed the language in its announcement today: “As was widely expected, the Bank of England raised interest rates by 50 basis points to 4%. More interesting than the decision itself, however, was the vote split, changes to the Banks forecasts, and its guidance. “Indeed, the Committee remains divided, with 2 of the 9 members voting for no change at this meeting. Revised forecasts see slightly stronger GDP growth and slightly lower inflation. That’s because activity data has been a little more resilient since the previous forecasts, while energy prices have fallen back. Nonetheless, the Bank is still forecasting a recession and inflation above target until well into next year. “The Bank’s guidance on the future path of policy was watered down a touch. It now reads “if there were to be evidence of more persistent pressures, then further tightening in monetary policy would be required”. That’s a little more caveated than the previous “should the economy evolve broadly in line with the November Monetary Policy Report projections, further increases in Bank Rate may be required”. “Taken together, this may indicate the Bank thinks it is getting close to the end of its hiking cycle.”



2 Feb 2023 09.35 EST Q: What is the Bank’s message to financial markets today – they may be tempted to declare victory for you on inflation now, and start loosening financial conditions…. The mssage for everyone, including financial markets, is that there is a very clear path downward on inflation, Andrew Bailey replies firmly. But, the BoE governor says there is also a lot of uncertainty around it, over the degree of risk and the timing. Bailey explains: The message I would give to financial markets is, we all have to watch this very carefully, and we will set policy to reflect how the economy evolves and how those risks evolve.



2 Feb 2023 09.31 EST Q: Is the Bank concerned that the tight labour market means inflation doesn’t fall to your 2% target for a long time? Governor Andrew Bailey agrees that there is tightness in the jobs market, so “yes, that is a big risk”. But other factors – such as government efforts to encourage people back into the jobs market – are also factors, he adds. The Bank’s top brass are wary of committing too much about the long term (perhaps remembering John Maynard Keynes famous quote) Deputy governor Ben Broadbent grins, and reminds the press conference that: Over the long term, we will set policy to ensure inflation is at the target.



2 Feb 2023 09.17 EST Bailey: Brexit hit has arrived faster than thought Back on Brexit…. governor Andrew Bailey says it is very hard to separate out the effects of Brexit, Covid and the energy crisis. These shocks have held back both productivity and labour supply, he said. But the Bank’s best judgement is that the long-run impact pf Brexit seems to have arrived more quickly than expected [as deputy governor Ben Broadbent said earlier].
