The Welsh government has given details of the revised pay offer to NHS staff that has led to the GMB union suspending its proposed strike by ambulance staff. (See 2.27pm.) A 4.5% pay increase has already been paid, but the Welsh government is offering an extra 3%, of which half is one-off, and half consolidated (ie, permanent, and rolled over for future years).

The spokesperson said:

Following continued discussions over the last week, we are pleased to announce that an enhanced pay offer has been made to our health trade unions.

On this basis, we are hopeful that the planned industrial action over Monday 6 and Tuesday 7 February will be postponed, allowing trade unions to discuss the proposals further with their members.

Individual trade unions will confirm their intentions regarding next weekâ€™s action, prior to further talks with their members.

This revised pay offer comprises an additional 3%, of which 1.5% is consolidated so will be in pay packets year on year, on top of the pay review body recommendations, which have already been implemented in full.

This offer will be backdated to April 2022. Included in this revised package are a number of non-pay commitments to enhance staff wellbeing, on which negotiations will continue next week.

Whilst there is currently no improved pay offer on the table for NHS staff in England, it was also agreed that any resulting Barnett consequential following any improved offer to staff in England would result in a further pay offer to staff in Wales.

We would like to thank those that have participated in the negotiations for their positive engagement and goodwill. We are awaiting a formal response from each of the individual trade unions.
