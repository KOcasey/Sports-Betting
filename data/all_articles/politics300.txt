As Nicola Sturgeon resigns as Scotland's first minister, BBC Scotland looks back at how she rose to the nation's highest office.

Her entry into full-time politics came when she was elected to the new Scottish Parliament in 1999 as a Glasgow regional MSP.

She has gone on to guide the SNP to wins in three general elections and two Holyrood ballots.

She now leaves office as Scotland's longest-serving first minister.
