The classified document scandal that has recently engulfed US politics appears to have spread to the Galactic Empire with news that a stash of classified documents regarding the new ‘Death Star’ weapon have been found in Darth Vader’s garage.

Darth Vader owns a luxury ranch on Zeltros where he often spends the holidays. At a recent retreat with high-ranking Empire officers, aides discovered a box in the garage containing classified documents detailing construction plans of the new so-called Death Star.

“Yesterday, several classified documents were discovered in my garage in a box underneath the workbench where I make my model buses,” explained the Sith Lord.

“The documents have been returned to the appropriate secure rooms at Imperial Headquarters on Ravelin. Those who discovered the documents have been…dealt with appropriately. I consider the matter closed.”

However there is a push from certain factions within the Empire high command for a full inquiry into exactly how the documents got into Lord Vader’s garage in the first place.

“I do think that its important to get to the facts of exactly what happened here,” said Admiral Motti.

“Perhaps Lord Vader is becoming careless. Perhaps his sad devotion to that ancient religion has confused him. We need to get to the bottom of this whole situation.”

It is expected that Lord Vader will shut down any such potential investigation by frightening Admiral Motti with his sorcerer’s ways.

The Rebellion has remained surprisingly quiet about the matter, with only Mon Mothma making the cryptic comment – “Bloody hell, I wish we’d known that before the whole Rogue One thing.”
