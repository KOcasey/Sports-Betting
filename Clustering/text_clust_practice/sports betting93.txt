National Football League NFL odds: Tom Brady's career from a sports betting perspective February 1 share facebook twitter reddit link

It's official: Tom Brady is retiring.

The legendary quarterback announced his decision on Wednesday via social media, ending a career many consider the greatest of all time.

Let's dive into Brady's run from a sports betting perspective.

Sportsbooks might send Brady a nice retirement gift, as the former New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback wrapped up his tenure in the league as the second-greatest QB of all time against the spread (ATS) in the regular season.

TB12 finished his overall career 215-158-8 (57.6%) ATS. Even more impressive? Brady finished 42-21-1 (66.7%) ATS as an underdog. Both those percentages included playoff games.

When looking at just regular-season games, he went 190-136-7 ATS, covering 58.3% of the time. That's downright astonishing in gambling. For context, if you had blindly bet on Brady in every single game of his career, you would have turned a tidy profit.

"Games featuring Tom Brady were always among the most bet on, and nine times out of 10, the public was backing Brady’s team," FOX Bet trading operations senior manager Dylan Brossman said. "‘Don’t bet against Brady,’ was consistently reinforced as a winning strategy, much to the chagrin of sportsbooks."

And for that, sports bettors and NFL fans alike thank you, Brady.

If TB12 finished second ATS in the regular season, who's first?

Of all quarterbacks to start at least 125 regular-season games in the Super Bowl Era, the only QB with a higher cover percentage than Brady is San Francisco 49ers great Joe Montana, who went 101-63 ATS in regular-season games over his career (61.6%).

So, once again, the battle for the title of GOAT comes down to Brady and Montana.
